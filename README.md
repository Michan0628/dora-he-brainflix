# dora-he-brainflix
This is a new project for video streaming platform called BrainFlix. This project will be broken into three parts: Sprint I, Sprint II, and Sprint III.

# Sprint 1

In sprint 1, I will create a functioning and responsive app prototype from the project designs provided.

# Sprint 2

In sprint 2, I am going to use API to build out the functionality of the front-end application. Second page for adding new video content is being added.

# Sprint 3

In sprint 3, I am going to build out my own API service that will manage the video data, and update the client application to use API service.
